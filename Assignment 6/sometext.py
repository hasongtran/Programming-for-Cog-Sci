Attention and Performance

Although much of our work explores what we can learn from contexts in which participants are unable to apply strategies 
due to various cognitive constraints, in some cases people are less constrained than believed. For example, under some 
circumstances, people can perform multiple tasks at once; a navy pilot can fly an aircraft, operate a radar, and manage 
tactical goals simultaneously. In other situations, multi-tasking appears problematic, for example driving while talking 
on a phone can lead to significant impairment even for experts. Researchers have asked whether the brain is inherently 
parallel and can coordinate multiple simultaneous processes, or whether there are structural bottlenecks making any 
apparent parallelism an illusion. One theory suggests that there is a central cognitive bottleneck such that when 
multiple stimuli in the world need to be responded to, they must be processed serially. Evidence for this comes from 
the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) task where participants are asked to respond to two stimuli separated by 
50-1000 milliseconds. Data show that when Stimulus2 is presented long after Stimulus1, Stimulus2 responses are fast. 
However, when the Stimulus2 arrives only 50 milliseconds after Stimulus1, its response is considerably slowed 
(called the "PRP effect"). Presumably, by 1 second participants have finished perceiving and responding to Stimulus1, 
and can thus respond to Stimulus2 right away. But with the small delay, Stimulus2 arrives while the participant is busy, 
forcing Response2 to wait (viz, Pashler 1994). Our view is that that the brain is inherently parallel and lacks 
central cognitive bottlenecks. Thus, with practice, humans can flexibly allocate cognitive resources and employ 
a variety of cognitive strategies. In some instances we use daring strategies that overlap the processing of multiple 
stimuli. At other times, we employ more cautious strategies that involve processing one stimulus at a time. In this 
work, we and our colleagues have show that PRP effects results from cautious strategies and not cognitive bottlenecks.

In one study, we found evidence against the bottleneck hypothesis and in support of flexible cognitive control. 
We showed that with practice, participants could overlap Task1 and Task2 processing, even when both task stimuli 
were presented simultaneously (0 ms delay)! We also showed that one factor influencing whether participants choose 
cautious or daring strategies in this task was the instructions given to them. In the typical PRP task, participants 
are encouraged to produce the Task1 response before the Task2 response, which encourages them to adopt a serial 
strategy and produce data consistent with a bottleneck. In this research, we had participants perform over the course 
of six days in a task where they were encouraged to produce both responses as quickly as possible. With these 
instructions, participants' data show no evidence of a bottleneck and they were not only able to process two stimuli 
and produce two responses at once, but their performance on each task was identical to when only one task had to be 
performed in isolation. On the seventh day, we asked these same participants to perform under the standard PRP 
instructions, and observed the typical PRP effect. Thus, we concluded that humans are flexible in choosing cautious or 
daring strategies, but may be affected in this choice by task constraints such as the instructions or reward schedule 
(Schumacher, Seymour, Glass, Kieras, & Meyer, 2001).

In another study we tested our hypothesis that PRP effects result from cautious strategies by comparing participants 
known to prefer daring task strategies to those known to prefer more cautious ones. In particular we compared young 
adults, who tend to do quite well on speeded cognitive tasks, to older adults, who have particular trouble with 
multiple-task performance. In a PRP task, all participants produced the standard effect, however older adults were 
slower overall and produced a larger PRP effect (showed greater Task2 slowing when the Task1-Task2 delay was short) 
than younger adults. Because numerous studies have reported general cognitive slowing with age 
(e.g., Somberg & Salthouse 1982), this finding may be the result of general slowing of a system with a central 
bottleneck, rather than a cautious strategy in a system with no bottleneck. To test this, we tested two sets of 
computational models; one set where differences between old and young participants were modeled as differences in 
overall processing speed; and one set where both processing speed and strategy type were modeled. The results showed 
that generalized slowing alone was not sufficient to account for the performance of older adults, and their data could 
only be successfully modeled when they were assumed to be slower and using a more cautious strategy compared to younger 
adults (Glass, Seymour, Schumacher, Gmeindl, Meyer, & Kieras, 1998). In other research, we showed that in some cases 
older adults were not slower than young participants after all, and that differences in performance could be completely 
accounted for by differences in strategy. Indeed, some daring older adults show no differences at all compared to 
younger adults. This research suggests that general slowing explanations may be overused when describing older adults' 
performance (Meyer, Glass, Mueller, Seymour, & Kieras, 2001).

In a more recent study, we have continued my interest in understanding cognitive constraints and strategy by comparing 
participants of different age ranges. In the dot-probe task, two small photographs 
(faces: one emotional and one neutral) are presented on either side of a computer monitor and then disappear 
revealing a dot behind one or the other. Participants are simply asked to quickly press a left or right button 
depending on where the dot is. Although they are irrelevant, the photographs can influence response time to the dots. 
An influential study by Mather & Carstensen (2003) showed that in this task, older adults responded faster to the dot 
if it was presented on the same side as a neutral face than if it was presented on the same side as a negative face. 
Younger adults exhibited no such "attentional bias". We wondered if, like cognitive slowing, this bias was more 
strategic than suggested in this work. The results of an eye-tracking study designed to answer this question suggest 
that although in a single-task condition older adults show the bias against negative faces, in a dual-task condition 
featuring a constantly distracting tone task, this effect reversed! This result confirms that the attentional bias is 
due to a cognitive strategy that requires sufficient attention to maintain, rather than a structural change associated 
with aging (Knight, Seymour, Gaunt, Baker, & Mather, 2007).

Status of Information in Memory

A central problem addressed in our research is how the status of information in memory affects its retrieval. For
example, if you tell a lie, will the memory for that lie operate in the same way as for truths you told at the same
time? Traditional “lie-detector” polygraphy (e.g., using heart rate, respiratory rate, and sweating) is an effective
interrogation tool (produces a higher confession rate), but is a poor method for identifying lies (National Research
Council, 2003). An alternative approach measures the recognition of information, rather than lying per se. These Guilty
Knowledge Tests (GKT) use a polygraphy paradigm where responses to presentations of crime-related and control stimuli
are compared. The assumption is that recognizing crime-related items will lead to feelings of anxiety, and in turn
larger physiological responses. Recent variations have included measures such as pupil dilation and brain activation in
regions known to be associated with recognizing personally significant stimuli. Unfortunately, such tests can be
expensive and cumbersome to implement. Furthermore, it is not clear if the “guilty” nature of crime information in
memory is critical to successful detection using the GKT.

Our work in this area has identified a measure based upon how long it takes someone to respond to crime information.
Previous recognition memory research demonstrates that while responses based on familiarity alone can be made quickly,
responding to some familiar items and ignoring others is slower. Inspired by this work, we developed a research paradigm
to examine the effects of having participants perform categorizations under fast response deadlines. In this paradigm,
participants commit a mock-crime and then memorize a set of benign target items. Later, in a speeded test, their
recognition of these items is measured. They are asked to truthfully respond “Yes” to familiar target items, and
deceptively respond “No” to familiar crime items, as well as new unfamiliar filler items. Despite their attempts to
conceal their knowledge of the crime items, participants’ deceptive responses to this information are consistently
slower and less accurate than to filler items (Seymour, Seifert, Shafto, & Mosmann, 2000). This test, accompanied with a
novel analysis technique, produced a significantly higher detection rate (94%-98%) than was typical with polygraph-based
GKTs, and a very low false positive rate (0%-3%). We proposed this (low cost) response time paradigm as a viable
alternative to the GKT and polygraph-based “lie-detectors.”

More recently, we have explored the applied viability of this paradigm, as well as the underlying cognitive mechanisms
involved. For example, does the type of information (e.g., verbal, vs. visual), or its status in memory (e.g., emotional
vs. benign) influence one’s ability to conceal their knowledge of it? In one study, we showed that my reaction time
paradigm was successful using pictures of faces (Seymour & Kerlin, 2008). Because we found identical reliability for
tests of phrases and faces, these results also suggest that the cognitive mechanisms underlying our test are not
peculiar to verbal memory. This is also important because most deception studies have focused on verbal stimuli despite
the increasing use of photographic evidence during trials and interrogations. This study also found nearly identical
results from tests based on mock-crimes and those from benign learning protocols. This suggests that the test’s
effectiveness is less dependent on the special status of crime items in memory than previously thought.

In another study, we examined whether the richness of information in memory influences our ability to detect it. For
example, some recent court cases using the GKT paradigm used peripheral crime scene details (such as the height of grass
growing at the scene) as test items whereas in other cases central items (such as the murder weapon) were used. We found
that for tests given immediately after the crime, both types of items are effective, but after long delays, only central
crime details lead to accurate classification (Seymour & Fraynt, 2009). Although tests using central items are
unaffected by time, those using peripheral items approach chance performance after one week. Finally, in response to
previous work suggesting that RT-based tests may be more susceptible to countermeasures than more traditional
psychophysiological measures. We have completed new in which we compare the influence of explicit countermeasures on the
detection efficiency of RT and skin conductance based GKTs. I found that overall both tests performed equally well and
were only minimally attenuated by the countermeasure. However, the skin conductance effect habituated more quickly than
with RTs.

We have recently completed work on an extended study comparing ocular and manual measures of concealed knowledge
(Seymour, Baker, & Gaunt, 2013). The project examines the potential of simultaneous measures of blinking, pupil size,
and response times to detect concealed knowledge. In previous studies, accuracy of ocular measures has been poor and
inconsistent, but we found strong classification accuracy for both the ocular and response time measures. This work is
the first to combine ocular and response time measures for multimodal lie detection. This approach leads to higher
detection rates than using either measure in isolation (except RT, which was already near 100%). The potentially
controversial possibility of using covert pupil measures without a participant’s awareness was also examined. We found
that the pupil effect is highly dependent on the response, casting considerable doubt on the possible success of its
covert use.
