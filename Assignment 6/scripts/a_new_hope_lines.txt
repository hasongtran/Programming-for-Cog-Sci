0020                A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
0021 
0022                A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
0023                War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
0024                into infinity.
0025 
0026                     It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
0027                     striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
0028                     victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
0029 
0030                     During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
0031                     secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
0032                     Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
0033                     power to destroy an entire planet.
0034 
0035                     Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
0036                     Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
0037                     the stolen plans that can save her people and 
0038                     restore freedom to the galaxy...
0039 
0040                The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
0041                eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
0042                silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
0043                from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
0044                by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
0045                laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
0046                the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
0047 
0048                INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
0049 
0050                An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
0051                D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
0052                through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
0053                old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
0054                face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
0055                Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
0056                human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
0057                surface of an Art Deco design.
0058 
0059                Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
0060 
0061                                      THREEPIO
0062                          Did you hear that? They've shut down 
0063                          the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
0064                          for sure. This is madness!
0065 
0066                Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
0067                the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
0068 
0069                                      THREEPIO
0070                          We're doomed!
0071 
0072                The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
0073                only another robot could understand.
0074 
0075                                      THREEPIO
0076                          There'll be no escape for the Princess 
0077                          this time.
0078 
0079                Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
0080                loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
0081                are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
0082 
0083                                      THREEPIO
0084                          What's that?
0085 
0086                EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
0087 
0088                The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade 
0089                Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the 
0090                underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
0091 
0092                INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
0093 
0094                The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a 
0095                tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and 
0096                a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make 
0097                their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
0098 
0099                In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with 
0100                laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns 
0101                creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
0102                behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers 
0103                who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered 
0104                arms and faces.
0105 
0106                An explosion hits near the robots.
0107 
0108                                      THREEPIO
0109                          I should have known better than to 
0110                          trust the logic of a half-sized 
0111                          thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
0112 
0113                Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages 
0114                around the two hapless robots.
0115 
0116                EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
0117 
0118                A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
0119                The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
0120                figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
0121                who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
0122                hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable 
0123                lad with a prize-winning smile.
0124 
0125                A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
0126                large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
0127                desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided 
0128                by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
0129                appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  
0130                A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and 
0131                he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
0132                utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
0133                the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired 
0134                Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet 
0135                above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the 
0136                tiny robot to follow him.
0137 
0138                                      LUKE
0139                          Hurry up! Come with me! What are you 
0140                          waiting for?! Get in gear!
0141 
0142                The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and 
0143                smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his 
0144                arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps 
0145                into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum 
0146                madly.
0147 
0148                INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY
0149 
0150                The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
0151                way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is 
0152                Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured 
0153                by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
0154                stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
0155                Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
0156                from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through 
0157                the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run 
0158                in a frenzied panic.

0160                INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
0161 
0162                A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  
0163                Artoo makes beeping sounds.
0164 
0165                INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
0166 
0167                Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is 
0168                nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel 
0169                soldiers can be heard in the distance.
0170 
0171                                      THREEPIO
0172                          Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
0173 
0174                A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and 
0175                he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
0176                filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
0177                old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
0178                dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
0179                something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
0180                robot joins his companion.
0181 
0182                                      THREEPIO
0183                          At last! Where have you been?
0184 
0185                Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
0186 
0187                                      THREEPIO
0188                          They're heading in this direction. 
0189                          What are we going to do? We'll be 
0190                          sent to the spice mine of Kessel or 
0191                          smashed into who knows what!
0192 
0193                Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the 
0194                subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
0195 
0196                                      THREEPIO
0197                          Wait a minute, where are you going?
0198 
0199                Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

0203                The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies 
0204                of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as 
0205                an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

0210 
0211                Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles 
0212                in vain.

0224                          We intercepted no transmissions. 
0225                          Aaah... This is a consular ship. 
0226                          Were on a diplomatic mission.

0231 
0232                The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the 
0233                Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a 
0234                gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. 
0235                Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to 
0236                his troops.

0247                The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the 
0248                stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia 
0249                Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her 
0250                eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds 
0251                of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the 
0252                troopers spots her.

0258                her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a

0268                He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
0269                begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into

0279                                      THREEPIO
0280                          Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
0281                          you overweight glob of grease! Now 
0282                          come out before somebody sees you.
0283 
0284                Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding 
0285                the mission he is about to perform.
0286 
0287                                      THREEPIO
0288                          Secret mission? What plans? What are 
0289                          you talking about? I'm not getting 
0290                          in there!
0291 
0292                Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps 
0293                and twangs angrily.
0294 
0295                A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
0296                through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, 
0297                after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky 
0298                robot jumps into the lifepod.
0299 
0300                                      THREEPIO
0301                          I'm going to regret this.

0305                On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified 
0306                robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

0313                          forms. It must have been short-
0314                          circuited.

0317 
0318                Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  
0319                Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
0320 
0321                                      THREEPIO
0322                          That's funny, the damage doesn't 
0323                          look as bad from out here.
0324 
0325                Artoo beeps an assuring response.
0326 
0327                                      THREEPIO
0328                          Are you sure this things safe?

0331 
0332                Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white 
0333                buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty 
0334                empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to 
0335                get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist 
0336                at Luke as he flies past.
0337 
0338                                      WOMAN

0341                INT. POWER STATION - DAY
0342 
0343                Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged 
0344                mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been 
0345                asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the 
0346                office, yelling wildly.
0347 
0348                                      FIXER
0349                          Did I hear a young noise blast through 
0350                          here?
0351 
0352                                      CAMIE
0353                          It was just wormie on another rampage.
0354 
0355                Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak 
0356                and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are 
0357                playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, 
0358                handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy 
0359                city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics 
0360                of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the 
0361                background.
0362 
0363                                      LUKE
0364                          Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
0365 
0366                Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great 
0367                joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
0368 
0369                                      LUKE
0370                          I didn't know you were back! When 
0371                          did you get in?
0372 
0373                                      BIGGS
0374                          Just now. I wanted to surprise you, 
0375                          hot shot. I thought you'd be here... 
0376                          certainly didn't expect you to be 
0377                          out working.
0378                               (he laughs)
0379 
0380                                      LUKE
0381                          The Academy didn't change you 
0382                          much...but you're back so soon? Hey, 
0383                          what happened, didn't you get your 
0384                          commission?
0385 
0386                Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
0387 
0388                                      BIGGS
0389                          Of course I got it. Signed aboard 
0390                          The Rand Ecliptic last week. First 
0391                          mate Biggs Darklighter at your 
0392                          service...
0393                               (he salutes)
0394                          ...I just came to say good-bye to 
0395                          all you unfortunate landlocked 
0396                          simpletons.
0397 
0398                Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend 
0399                is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of 
0400                it.
0401 
0402                                      LUKE
0403                          I almost forgot. There's a battle 
0404                          going on! Right here in our system. 
0405                          Come and look!

0412 
0413                The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie 
0414                and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. 
0415                Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
0416 
0417                                      LUKE
0418                          There they are!
0419 
0420                Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to 
0421                see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars 
0422                Biggs sees two small silver specks.
0423 
0424                                      BIGGS
0425                          That's no battle, hot shot... they're 
0426                          just sitting there! Probably a 
0427                          freighter-tanker refueling.
0428 
0429                                      LUKE
0430                          But there was a lot of firing 
0431                          earlier...
0432 
0433                Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the 
0434                building in the process. Luke grabs them.
0435 
0436                                      LUKE
0437                          Hey, easy with those...
0438 
0439                                      CAMIE
0440                          Don't worry about it, Wormie.
0441 
0442                The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs 
0443                his shoulders in resignation.
0444 
0445                                      FIXER
0446                          I keep telling you, the Rebellion is 
0447                          a long way from here. I doubt if the 
0448                          Empire would even fight to keep this 
0449                          system. Believe me Luke, this planet 
0450                          is a big hunk of nothing...
0451 
0452                Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The 
0453                group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about 
0454                Luke's ineptitude.
0455 
0456                INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY
0457 
0458                Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad 
0459                of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is 
0460                brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly 
0461                marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader 
0462                emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard 
0463                at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
0464 
0465                                      LEIA
0466                          Lord Vader, I should have known. 
0467                          Only you could be so bold. The 
0468                          Imperial Senate will not sit for 
0469                          this, when they hear you've attacked 
0470                          a diplomatic...

0473                          Don't play games with me, Your 
0474                          Highness. You weren't on any mercy 
0475                          mission this time. You passed directly 
0476                          through a restricted system. Several 
0477                          transmissions were beamed to this 
0478                          ship by Rebel spies. I want to know 
0479                          what happened to the plans they sent 
0480                          you.
0481 
0482                                      LEIA
0483                          I don't know what you're talking 
0484                          about. I'm a member of the Imperial 
0485                          Senate on a diplomatic mission to 
0486                          Alderaan...

0489                          You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... 
0490                          and a traitor. Take her away!
0491 
0492                Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering 
0493                hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander 
0494                turns to Vader.

0497                          Holding her is dangerous. If word of 
0498                          this gets out, it could generate 
0499                          sympathy for the Rebellion in the 
0500                          senate.

0503                          I have traced the Rebel spies to 
0504                          her. Now she is my only link to find 
0505                          their secret base!
0506 
0507                                      COMMANDER
0508                          She'll die before she tells you 
0509                          anything.
0510 
0511                                      VADER
0512                          Leave that to me. Send a distress 
0513                          signal and then inform the senate 
0514                          that all aboard were killed!
0515 
0516                Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. 
0517                They stop and snap to attention.
0518 
0519                                      SECOND OFFICER
0520                          Lord Vader, the battle station plans 
0521                          are not aboard this ship! And no 
0522                          transmissions were made. An escape 
0523                          pod was jettisoned during the 
0524                          fighting, but no life forms were 
0525                          aboard.
0526 
0527                Vader turns to the Commander.
0528 
0529                                      VADER
0530                          She must have hidden the plans in 
0531                          the escape pod. Send a detachment 
0532                          down to retrieve them. See to it 
0533                          personally, Commander. There'll be 
0534                          no one to stop us this time.

0537                          Yes, sir.

0539                EXT. SPACE
0540 
0541                The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the 
0542                planet Tatooine.
0543 
0544                EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT
0545 
0546                Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas 
0547                meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids 
0548                kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily 
0549                work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in 
0550                the distance rests half buried in the sand.
0551 
0552                                      THREEPIO
0553                          How did I get into this mess? I really 
0554                          don't know how. We seem to be made 
0555                          to suffer. It's our lot in life.
0556 
0557                Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
0558 
0559                                      THREEPIO
0560                          I've got to rest before I fall apart. 
0561                          My joints are almost frozen.
0562 
0563                Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
0564 
0565                                      THREEPIO
0566                          What a desolate place this is.
0567 
0568                Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts 
0569                off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio 
0570                stops and yells at him.
0571 
0572                                      THREEPIO
0573                          Where are you going?
0574 
0575                A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small 
0576                robot.
0577 
0578                                      THREEPIO
0579                          Well, I'm not going that way. It's 
0580                          much too rocky. This way is much 
0581                          easier.
0582 
0583                Artoo counters with a long whistle.
0584 
0585                                      THREEPIO
0586                          What makes you think there are 
0587                          settlements over there?
0588 
0589                Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
0590 
0591                                      THREEPIO
0592                          Don't get technical with me.
0593 
0594                Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
0595 
0596                                      THREEPIO
0597                          What mission? What are you talking 
0598                          about? I've had just about enough of 
0599                          you! Go that way! You'll be 
0600                          malfunctioning within a day, you 
0601                          nearsighted scrap pile!
0602 
0603                Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the 
0604                direction of the vast dune sea.
0605 
0606                                      THREEPIO
0607                          And don't let me catch you following 
0608                          me begging for help, because you 
0609                          won't get it.
0610 
0611                Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges 
0612                off in the direction of the towering mesas.
0613 
0614                                      THREEPIO
0615                          No more adventures. I'm not going 
0616                          that way.
0617 
0618                Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant 
0619                mountains.
0620 
0621                EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA
0622 
0623                Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a 
0624                dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
0625                miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant 
0626                rock mesas.
0627 
0628                                      THREEPIO
0629                          That malfunctioning little twerp. 
0630                          This is all his fault! He tricked me 
0631                          into going this way, but he'll do no 
0632                          better.
0633 
0634                In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand 
0635                from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of 
0636                reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving 
0637                towards him.
0638 
0639                                      THREEPIO
0640                          Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm 
0641                          saved!
0642 
0643                The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the 
0644                approaching transport.
0645 
0646                                      THREEPIO
0647                          Over here! Help! Please, help!
0648 
0649                EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
0650 
0651                Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer 
0652                and the others can be heard working inside.
0653 
0654                                      LUKE
0655                               (Very animated)
0656                          ...so I cut off my power, shut down 
0657                          the afterburners and came in low on 
0658                          Deak's trail. I was so close I thought 
0659                          I was going to fry my instruments. 
0660                          As it was I busted up the Skyhopper 
0661                          pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty 
0662                          upset. He grounded me for the rest 
0663                          of the season. You should have been 
0664                          there... it was fantastic.
0665 
0666                                      BIGGS
0667                          You ought to take it easy Luke. You 
0668                          may be the hottest bushpilot this 
0669                          side of Mos Eisley, but those little 
0670                          Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it 
0671                          up, and one day, whammo, you're going 
0672                          to be nothing more than a dark spot 
0673                          on the down side of a canyon wall.
0674 
0675                                      LUKE
0676                          Look who's talking. Now that you've 
0677                          been around those giant starships 
0678                          you're beginning to sound like my 
0679                          uncle. You've gotten soft in the 
0680                          city...
0681 
0682                                      BIGGS
0683                          I've missed you kid.
0684 
0685                                      LUKE
0686                          Well, things haven't been the same 
0687                          since you left, Biggs. It's been 
0688                          so... quiet.
0689 
0690                Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
0691 
0692                                      BIGGS
0693                          Luke, I didn't come back just to say 
0694                          good-bye... I shouldn't tell you 
0695                          this, but you're the only one I can 
0696                          trust... and if I don't come back, I 
0697                          want somebody to know.
0698 
0699                Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.
0700 
0701                                      LUKE
0702                          What are you talking about?
0703 
0704                                      BIGGS
0705                          I made some friends at the Academy.
0706                               (he whispers)
0707                          ...when our frigate goes to one of 
0708                          the central systems, we're going to 
0709                          jump ship and join the Alliance...
0710 
0711                Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
0712 
0713                                      LUKE
0714                          Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! 
0715                          How?
0716 
0717                                      BIGGS
0718                          Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth 
0719                          bigger than a meteor crater!
0720 
0721                                      LUKE
0722                          I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
0723                               (he whispers)
0724                          Listen how quiet I am. You can barely 
0725                          hear me...
0726 
0727                Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
0728 
0729                                      BIGGS
0730                          My friend has a friend on Bestine 
0731                          who might help us make contact.
0732 
0733                                      LUKE
0734                          You're crazy! You could wander around 
0735                          forever trying to find them.
0736 
0737                                      BIGGS
0738                          I know it's a long shot, but if I 
0739                          don't find them I'll do what I can 
0740                          on my own... It's what we always 
0741                          talked about. Luke, I'm not going to 
0742                          wait for the Empire to draft me into 
0743                          service. The Rebellion is spreading 
0744                          and I want to be on the right side -- 
0745                          the side I believe in.
0746 
0747                                      LUKE
0748                          And I'm stuck here...
0749 
0750                                      BIGGS
0751                          I thought you were going to the 
0752                          Academy next term. You'll get your 
0753                          chance to get off this rock.
0754 
0755                                      LUKE
0756                          Not likely! I had to cancel my 
0757                          application. There has been a lot of 
0758                          unrest among the Sandpeople since 
0759                          you left... they've even raided the 
0760                          outskirts of Anchorhead.
0761 
0762                                      BIGGS
0763                          Your uncle could hold off a whole 
0764                          colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
0765 
0766                                      LUKE
0767                          I know, but he's got enough vaporators 
0768                          going to make the place pay off. He 
0769                          needs me for just one more season. I 
0770                          can't leave him now.
0771 
0772                                      BIGGS
0773                          I feel for you, Luke, you're going 
0774                          to have to learn what seems to be 
0775                          important or what really is important. 
0776                          What good is all your uncle's work 
0777                          if it's taken over by the Empire?... 
0778                          You know they're starting to 
0779                          nationalize commerce in the central 
0780                          systems... it won't be long before 
0781                          your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving 
0782                          for the greater glory of the Empire.
0783 
0784                                      LUKE
0785                          It couldn't happen here. You said it 
0786                          yourself. The Empire won't bother 
0787                          with this rock.

0793                          I wish I was going... Are you going 
0794                          to be around long?
0795

0800                          Then I guess I won't see you.

0803                          Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

0806                          Well, I'll be at the Academy next 
0807                          season... after that who knows. I 
0808                          won't be drafted into the Imperial 
0809                          Starfleet that's for sure... Take 
0810                          care of yourself, you'll always be 
0811                          the best friend I've got.

0814                          So long, Luke.
0815 
0816                Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the 
0817                power station.
0818 
0819                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET
0820 
0821                The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
0822                foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
0823                fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
0824                canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
0825                goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
0826                a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
0827 
0828                In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
0829                and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
0830                further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
0831                pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
0832                narrow path.
0833 
0834                The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until 
0835                suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out 
0836                of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages 
0837                one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his 
0838                back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then 
0839                off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller 
0840                than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they 
0841                cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and 
0842                their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be 
0843                seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave 
0844                the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down 
0845                the trail.
0846 
0847                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
0848 
0849                The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
0850                like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a 
0851                small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a 
0852                large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot 
0853                is sucked into the giant machine.
0854 
0855                The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders 
0856                and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
0857 
0858                INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA
0859 
0860                It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
0861                switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
0862                around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
0863                metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
0864                maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper 
0865                and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end 
0866                of the chamber.
0867 
0868                INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA
0869 
0870                Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the 
0871                middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various 
0872                shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, 
0873                while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls 
0874                out from the gloom.
0875 
0876                                      THREEPIO
0877                          Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
0878 
0879                A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.
0880 
0881                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
0882 
0883                The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
0884                twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
0885                ridge.
0886 
0887                EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY
0888 
0889                Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
0890                buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. 
0891                A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
0892 
0893                                      FIRST TROOPER
0894                          Someone was in the pod. The tracks 
0895                          go off in this direction.
0896 
0897                A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand 
0898                and gives it to the first trooper.
0899 
0900                                      SECOND TROOPER
0901                          Look, sir -- droids.
0902 
0903                EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES
0904 
0905                The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.
0906 
0907                INT. SANDCRAWLER
0908 
0909                Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped 
0910                prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
0911 
0912                                      THREEPIO
0913                          Wake up! Wake up!
0914 
0915                Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
0916                creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
0917                Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
0918                pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
0919                chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
0920                white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
0921                odd assortment of robots.
0922 
0923                                      THREEPIO
0924                          We're doomed.
0925 
0926                A Jawa starts moving toward them.
0927 
0928                                      THREEPIO
0929                          Do you think they'll melt us down?
0930 
0931                Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
0932 
0933                                      THREEPIO
0934                          Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this 
0935                          never end?
0936 
0937                EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
0938 
0939                The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their 
0940                battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of 
0941                the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small 
0942                homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground 
0943                surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small 
0944                adobe block house.
0945 
0946                The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
0947                them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
0948                The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
0949                small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
0950                should be.
0951 
0952                Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
0953                a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
0954                sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
0955                inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
0956                shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
0957                Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
0958                pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
0959 
0960                A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the 
0961                homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru 
0962                standing in the main courtyard.
0963 
0964                                      BERU
0965                          Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a 
0966                          translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
0967

0969                          It looks like we don't have much of 
0970                          a choice but I'll remind him.
0971 
0972                Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment 
0973                for sale with the Jawa leader.

0982                          programmed for over thirty secondary

0986                          What I really need is a droid that 
0987                          understands the binary language of 
0988                          moisture vaporators.

0992                          programming binary load lifter... 
0993                          very similar to your vaporators. You 
0994                          could say...

1000                          Of course I can, sir. It's like a 
1001                          second language for me... I'm as 
1002                          fluent in Bocce...

1029                          go.
1030 
1031                As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back 
1032                into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep 
1033                and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained 
1034                by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
1035 
1036                Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two 
1037                robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the 
1038                head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

1051                               (to the head Jawa)
1052                          Hey, what're you trying to push on 
1053                          us?
1054 
1055                The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
1056                out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
1057                attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
1058                Luke on the shoulder.
1059 
1060                                      THREEPIO
1061                               (pointing to Artoo)
1062                          Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is 
1063                          in prime condition. A real bargain.
1064 
1065                                      LUKE
1066                          Uncle Owen...
1067 
1068                                      OWEN
1069                          Yeah?
1070 
1071                                      LUKE
1072                          What about that one?
1073 
1074                                      OWEN
1075                               (to Jawa)
1076                          What about that blue one? We'll take 
1077                          that one.
1078 
1079                With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged 
1080                astro-droid for Artoo.
1081 
1082                                      LUKE
1083                          Yeah, take it away.
1084 
1085                                      THREEPIO
1086                          Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
1087                          pleased with that one, sir. He really 
1088                          is in first-class condition. I've 
1089                          worked with him before. Here he comes.
1090 
1091                Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots 
1092                trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
1093 
1094                                      LUKE
1095                          Okay, let's go.
1096 
1097                                      THREEPIO
1098                               (to Artoo)
1099                          Now, don't you forget this! Why I 
1100                          should stick my neck out for you is 
1101                          quite beyond my capacity!
1102 
1103                INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
1104 
1105                The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
1106                atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
1107                himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
1108                battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
1109                with a cord to his face.
1110 
1111                                      THREEPIO
1112                          Thank the maker! This oil bath is 
1113                          going to feel so good. I've got such 
1114                          a bad case of dust contamination, I 
1115                          can barely move!
1116 
1117                Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought 
1118                as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man 
1119                Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. 
1120                Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he 
1121                slams a wrench across the workbench.
1122 
1123                                      LUKE
1124                          It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is 
1125                          right. I'm never gonna get out of 
1126                          here!
1127 
1128                                      THREEPIO
1129                          Is there anything I might do to help?
1130 
1131                Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains 
1132                and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
1133 
1134                                      LUKE
1135                          Well, not unless you can alter time, 
1136                          speed up the harvest, or teleport me 
1137                          off this rock!
1138 
1139                                      THREEPIO
1140                          I don't think so, sir. I'm only a 
1141                          droid and not very knowledgeable 
1142                          about such things. Not on this planet, 
1143                          anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm 
1144                          not even sure which planet I'm on.
1145 
1146                                      LUKE
1147                          Well, if there's a bright center to 
1148                          the universe, you're on the planet 
1149                          that it's farthest from.
1150 
1151                                      THREEPIO
1152                          I see, sir.
1153 
1154                                      LUKE
1155                          Uh, you can call me Luke.
1156 
1157                                      THREEPIO
1158                          I see, sir Luke.
1159 
1160                                      LUKE
1161                               (laughing)
1162                          Just Luke.
1163 
1164                                      THREEPIO
1165                          And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
1166                          relations, and this is my counterpart, 
1167                          Artoo-Detoo.
1168 
1169                                      LUKE
1170                          Hello.
1171 
1172                Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
1173                scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome 
1174                pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping 
1175                oil from his bronze body.
1176 
1177                                      LUKE
1178                          You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
1179                          It looks like you boys have seen a 
1180                          lot of action.
1181 
1182                                      THREEPIO
1183                          With all we've been through, sometimes 
1184                          I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
1185                          as we are, what with the Rebellion 
1186                          and all.
1187 
1188                                      LUKE
1189                          You know of the Rebellion against 
1190                          the Empire?
1191 
1192                                      THREEPIO
1193                          That's how we came to be in your 
1194                          service, if you take my meaning, 
1195                          sir.
1196 
1197                                      LUKE
1198                          Have you been in many battles?
1199 
1200                                      THREEPIO
1201                          Several, I think. Actually, there's 
1202                          not much to tell. I'm not much more 
1203                          than an interpreter, and not very 
1204                          good at telling stories. Well, not 
1205                          at making them interesting, anyways.
1206 
1207                Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
1208                neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
1209 
1210                                      LUKE
1211                          Well, my little friend, you've got 
1212                          something jammed in here real good. 
1213                          Were you on a cruiser or...
1214 
1215                The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling 
1216                head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
1217                dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
1218                projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a 
1219                rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly 
1220                lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
1221 
1222                                      LEIA
1223                          Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
1224                          only hope.
1225 
1226                                      LUKE
1227                          What's this?
1228 
1229                Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio 
1230                to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
1231                over and over.
1232 
1233                                      THREEPIO
1234                          What is what?!? He asked you a 
1235                          question...
1236                               (pointing to Leia)
1237                          What is that?
1238 
1239                Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice 
1240                the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer 
1241                for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the 
1242                sentence fragment over and over.
1243 
1244                                      LEIA
1245                          Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
1246                          only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
1247                          You're my only hope.
1248 
1249                                      THREEPIO
1250                          Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
1251                          a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no 
1252                          mind.
1253 
1254                Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
1255 
1256                                      LUKE
1257                          Who is she? She's beautiful.
1258 
1259                                      THREEPIO
1260                          I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
1261 
1262                                      LEIA
1263                          Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
1264 
1265                                      THREEPIO
1266                          I think she was a passenger on our 
1267                          last voyage. A person of some 
1268                          importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
1269                          captain was attached to...
1270 
1271                                      LUKE
1272                          Is there more to this recording?
1273 
1274                Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
1275                squeaks and a whistle.
1276 
1277                                      THREEPIO
1278                          Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
1279                          to get us in trouble. It's all right, 
1280                          you can trust him. He's our new 
1281                          master.
1282 
1283                Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
1284 
1285                                      THREEPIO
1286                          He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
1287                          Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
1288                          And it's a private message for him. 
1289                          Quite frankly, sir I don't know what 
1290                          he's talking about. Our last master 
1291                          was Captain Antilles, but with what 
1292                          we've been through, this little R2 
1293                          unit has become a bit eccentric.
1294 
1295                                      LUKE
1296                          Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
1297                          old Ben Kenobi?
1298 
1299                                      THREEPIO
1300                          I beg your pardon, sir, but do you 
1301                          know what he's talking about?
1302 
1303                                      LUKE
1304                          Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
1305                          Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
1306                          the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
1307                          old hermit.
1308 
1309                Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few 
1310                moments.
1311 
1312                                      LUKE
1313                          I wonder who she is. It sounds like 
1314                          she's in trouble. I'd better play 
1315                          back the whole thing.
1316 
1317                Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
1318 
1319                                      THREEPIO
1320                          He says the restraining bolt has 
1321                          short circuited his recording system. 
1322                          He suggests that if you remove the 
1323                          bolt, he might be able to play back 
1324                          the entire recording.
1325 
1326                Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
1327                really heard what Threepio has been saying.
1328 
1329                                      LUKE
1330                          H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're 
1331                          too small to run away on me if I 
1332                          take this off! Okay.
1333 
1334                Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
1335                Artoo's side.
1336 
1337                                      LUKE
1338                          There you go.
1339 
1340                The princess immediately disappears...
1341 
1342                                      LUKE
1343                          Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
1344                          Bring her back! Play back the entire 
1345                          message.
1346 
1347                Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
1348                embarrassment.
1349 
1350                                      THREEPIO
1351                          What message? The one you're carrying 
1352                          inside your rusty innards!
1353 
1354                A women's voice calls out from another room.
1355 
1356                                      AUNT BERU
1357                          Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
1358 
1359                Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning 
1360                robot.
1361 
1362                                      LUKE
1363                          All right, I'll be right there, Aunt 
1364                          Beru.
1365 
1366                                      THREEPIO
1367                          I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to 
1368                          have picked up a slight flutter.
1369 
1370                Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
1371                hurries out of the room.
1372 
1373                                      LUKE
1374                          Well, see what you can do with him. 
1375                          I'll be right back.
1376 
1377                                      THREEPIO
1378                               (to Artoo)
1379                          Just you reconsider playing that 
1380                          message for him.
1381 
1382                Artoo beeps in response.
1383 
1384                                      THREEPIO
1385                          No, I don't think he likes you at 
1386                          all.
1387 
1388                Artoo beeps.
1389 
1390                                      THREEPIO
1391                          No, I don't like you either.
1392 
1393                INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA
1394 
1395                Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher 
1396                with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
1397                used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls 
1398                of food and starts for the dining area.
1399 
1400                Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with 
1401                steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red 
1402                grain.
1403 
1404                                      LUKE
1405                          You know, I think that R2 unit we 
1406                          bought might have been stolen.
1407 
1408                                      OWEN
1409                          What makes you think that?
1410 
1411                                      LUKE
1412                          Well, I stumbled across a recording 
1413                          while I was cleaning him. He says he 
1414                          belongs to someone called Obi-Wan 
1415                          Kenobi.
1416 
1417                Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but 
1418                manages to control himself.
1419 
1420                                      LUKE
1421                          I thought he might have meant old 
1422                          Ben. Do you know what he's talking 
1423                          about? Well, I wonder if he's related 
1424                          to Ben.
1425 
1426                Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
1427 
1428                                      OWEN
1429                          That old man's just a crazy old 
1430                          wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take 
1431                          that R2 unit into Anchorhead and 
1432                          have its memory flushed. That'll be 
1433                          the end of it. It belongs to us now.
1434 
1435                                      LUKE
1436                          But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking 
1437                          for him?
1438 
1439                                      OWEN
1440                          He won't, I don't think he exists 
1441                          any more. He died about the same 
1442                          time as your father.
1443 
1444                                      LUKE
1445                          He knew my father?
1446 
1447                                      OWEN
1448                          I told you to forget it. Your only 
1449                          concern is to prepare the new droids 
1450                          for tomorrow. In the morning I want 
1451                          them on the south ridge working out 
1452                          those condensers.
1453 
1454                                      LUKE
1455                          Yes, sir. I think those new droids 
1456                          are going to work out fine. In fact, 
1457                          I, uh, was also thinking about our 
1458                          agreement about my staying on another 
1459                          season. And if these new droids do 
1460                          work out, I want to transmit my 
1461                          application to the Academy this year.
1462 
1463                Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress 
1464                it.
1465 
1466                                      OWEN
1467                          You mean the next semester before 
1468                          harvest?
1469 
1470                                      LUKE
1471                          Sure, there're more than enough 
1472                          droids.
1473 
1474                                      OWEN
1475                          Harvest is when I need you the most. 
1476                          Only one more season. This year we'll 
1477                          make enough on the harvest so I'll 
1478                          be able to hire some more hands. And 
1479                          then you can go to the Academy next 
1480                          year.
1481 
1482                Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
1483 
1484                                      OWEN
1485                          You must understand I need you here, 
1486                          Luke.
1487 
1488                                      LUKE
1489                          But it's a whole 'nother year.
1490 
1491                                      OWEN
1492                          Look, it's only one more season.
1493 
1494                Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
1495 
1496                                      LUKE
1497                          Yeah, that's what you said last year 
1498                          when Biggs and Tank left.
1499 
1500                                      AUNT BERU
1501                          Where are you going?
1502 
1503                                      LUKE
1504                          It looks like I'm going nowhere. I 
1505                          have to finish cleaning those droids.
1506 
1507                Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen 
1508                mechanically finishes his dinner.
1509 
1510                                      AUNT BERU
1511                          Owen, he can't stay here forever. 
1512                          Most of his friends have gone. It 
1513                          means so much to him.
1514 
1515                                      OWEN
1516                          I'll make it up to him next year. I 
1517                          promise.
1518 
1519                                      AUNT BERU
1520                          Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He 
1521                          has too much of his father in him.
1522 
1523                                      OWEN
1524                          That's what I'm afraid of.
1525 
1526                EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
1527 
1528                The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a 
1529                distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few 
1530                moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the 
1531                homestead.
1532 
1533                INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE
1534 
1535                Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in 
1536                sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt 
1537                similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the 
1538                box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a 
1539                short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
1540 
1541                                      LUKE
1542                          What are you doing hiding there?
1543 
1544                Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in 
1545                sight.
1546 
1547                                      THREEPIO
1548                          It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't 
1549                          deactivate me. I told him not to go, 
1550                          but he's faulty, malfunctioning; 
1551                          kept babbling on about his mission.
1552 
1553                                      LUKE
1554                          Oh, no!
1555 
1556                Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.
1557 
1558                EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
1559 
1560                Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead 
1561                and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
1562                robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the 
1563                salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his 
1564                electrobinoculars.
1565 
1566                                      THREEPIO
1567                          That R2 unit has always been a 
1568                          problem. These astro-droids are 
1569                          getting quite out of hand. Even I 
1570                          can't understand their logic at times.
1571 
1572                                      LUKE
1573                          How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere 
1574                          in sight. Blast it!
1575 
1576                                      THREEPIO
1577                          Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go 
1578                          after him?
1579 
1580                                      LUKE
1581                          It's too dangerous with all the 
1582                          Sandpeople around. We'll have to 
1583                          wait until morning.
1584 
1585                Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
1586 
1587                                      OWEN
1588                          Luke, I'm shutting the power down 
1589                          for the night.
1590 
1591                                      LUKE
1592                          All right, I'll be there in a few 
1593                          minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.
1594 
1595                He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
1596 
1597                                      LUKE
1598                          You know that little droid is going 
1599                          to cause me a lot of trouble.
1600 
1601                                      THREEPIO
1602                          Oh, he excels at that, sir.
1603 
1604                INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA
1605 
1606                Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of 
1607                the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of 
1608                Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
1609 
1610                                      OWEN
1611                          Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be 
1612                          loafing now!

1615 
1616                The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru 
1617                prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.
1618 
1619                                      OWEN
1620                          Have you seen Luke this morning?
1621 
1622                                      AUNT BERU
1623                          He said he had some things to do 
1624                          before he started today, so he left 
1625                          early.
1626 
1627                                      OWEN
1628                          Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
1629                          with him?
1630 
1631                                      AUNT BERU
1632                          I think so.
1633 
1634                                      OWEN
1635                          Well, he'd better have those units 
1636                          in the south range repaired be midday 
1637                          or there'll be hell to pay!
1638 
1639                EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY
1640 
1641                The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio 
1642                pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast 
1643                wasteland.

1647 
1648                Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something 
1649                in the motor compartment.
1650 
1651                                      LUKE

1653                          How's that.
1654 
1655                Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the 
1656                wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
1657 
1658                                      LUKE
1659                          Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this 
1660                          direction somewhere, but I don't see 
1661                          how that R2 unit could have come 
1662                          this far. We must have missed him. 
1663                          Uncle Owen isn't going to take this 
1664                          very well.
1665 
1666                                      THREEPIO
1667                          Sir, would it help if you told him 
1668                          it was my fault.
1669 
1670                                      LUKE
1671                               (brightening)
1672                          Sure. He needs you. He'd probably 
1673                          only deactivate you for a day or 
1674                          so...
1675 
1676                                      THREEPIO
1677                          Deactivate! Well, on the other hand 
1678                          if you hadn't removed his restraining 
1679                          bolt...
1680

1682                          Wait, there's something dead ahead 
1683                          on the scanner. It looks like our 
1684                          droid... hit the accelerator.
1685 
1686                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY
1687 
1688                From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen 
1689                gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground 
1690                two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert 
1691                cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the 
1692                marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle 
1693                and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs 
1694                the gun before it can be fired.
1695 
1696                The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, 
1697                speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an 
1698                animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in 
1699                the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

1701                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON
1702 
1703                The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied 
1704                to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large 
1705                as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, 
1706                and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders 
1707                mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs 
1708                and ride off down the rugged bluff.

1711 
1712                The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, 
1713                with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands 
1714                before little Artoo.
1715 
1716                                      LUKE
1717                          Hey, whoa, just where do you think 
1718                          you're going?
1719 
1720                The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses 
1721                menacingly behind the little runaway.
1722 
1723                                      THREEPIO
1724                          Master Luke here is your rightful 
1725                          owner. We'll have no more of this 
1726                          Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't 
1727                          talk to me about your mission, either. 
1728                          You're fortunate he doesn't blast 
1729                          you into a million pieces right here.

1731                                      LUKE
1732                          Well, come on. It's getting late. I 
1733                          only hope we can get back before 
1734                          Uncle Owen really blows up.
1735 
1736                                      THREEPIO
1737                          If you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
1738                          I think you should deactivate the 
1739                          little fugitive until you've gotten 
1740                          him back to your workshop.

1744 
1745                Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic 
1746                whistles and screams.

1749                          What's wrong with him now?
1750 
1751                                      THREEPIO
1752                          Oh my... sir, he says there are 
1753                          several creatures approaching from 
1754                          the southeast.
1755 
1756                Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
1757 
1758                                      LUKE
1759                          Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's 
1760                          have a look. Come on.
1761 
1762                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY
1763 
1764                Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and 
1765                scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
1766                two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
1767                adventurer.
1768 
1769                                      LUKE
1770                          There are two Banthas down there but 
1771                          I don't see any... wait a second, 
1772                          they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
1773                          see one of them now.
1774 
1775                Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
1776                electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of 
1777                his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
1778                gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled 
1779                and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be 
1780                heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
1781                down the side of the mountain.
1782 
1783                The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
1784                gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in 
1785                the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block 
1786                the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. 
1787                The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced 
1788                to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
1789                over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible 
1790                shrieking laugh.
1791 
1792                EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY
1793 
1794                Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in 
1795                the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the 
1796                inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the 
1797                speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts 
1798                and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then 
1799                everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan 
1800                is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the 
1801                Sandpeople fleeing in terror.
1802 
1803                Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
1804                swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even 
1805                closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and 
1806                leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and 
1807                weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating 
1808                eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes 
1809                as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a 
1810                slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

1816                Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and 
1817                begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on 
1818                Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

1842                          searching for his former master... 
1843                          I've never seen such devotion in a 
1844                          droid before... there seems to be no 
1845                          stopping him. He claims to be the 
1846                          property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he 
1847                          a relative of yours? Do you know who

1888                Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic 
1889                beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

1897                to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and 
1898                Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half 
1899                buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

1901                Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then 
1902                flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally 
1903                the mechanical man's systems turn on.

1925                Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little 
1926                Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around 
1927                suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the 
1928                air.

1935                The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but 
1936                still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and 
1937                security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as 
1938                old Ben sits thinking.

1968                Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  
1969                As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the 
1970                restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  
1971                Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the 
1972                table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle 
1973                with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

1979                          wouldn't allow it. He feared you 
1980                          might follow old Obi-Wan on some

2001                Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out

2063                          request to you in person, but my 
2064                          ship has fallen under attack and I'm 
2065                          afraid my mission to bring you to 
2066                          Alderaan has failed. I have placed 
2067                          information vital to the survival of 
2068                          the Rebellion into the memory systems 
2069                          of this R2 unit. My father will know 
2070                          how to retrieve it. You must see 
2071                          this droid safely delivered to him 
2072                          on Alderaan. This is our most 
2073                          desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan 
2074                          Kenobi, you're my only hope.

2076                There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  
2077                Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs 
2078                on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

2125                An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like 
2126                battle station: the Death Star!
2127 
2128                INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
2129 
2130                Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black 
2131                conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around 
2132                the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, 
2133                is speaking.
2134 
2135                                      TAGGE
2136                          Until this battle station is fully 
2137                          operational we are vulnerable. The 
2138                          Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
2139                          They're more dangerous than you 
2140                          realize.
2141 
2142                The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
2143 
2144                                      MOTTI
2145                          Dangerous to your starfleet, 
2146                          Commander, not to this battle station!
2147 
2148                                      TAGGE
2149                          The Rebellion will continue to gain 
2150                          a support in the Imperial Senate as 
2151                          long as....
2152 
2153                Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut 
2154                short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial 
2155                outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, 
2156                The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and 
2157                bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his 
2158                place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind 
2159                him.
2160 
2161                                      TARKIN
2162                          The Imperial Senate will no longer 
2163                          be of any concern to us. I've just 
2164                          received word that the Emperor has 
2165                          dissolved the council permanently. 
2166                          The last remnants of the Old Republic 
2167                          have been swept away.
2168 
2169                                      TAGGE
2170                          That's impossible! How will the 
2171                          Emperor maintain control without the 
2172                          bureaucracy?
2173 
2174                                      TARKIN
2175                          The regional governors now have direct 
2176                          control over territories. Fear will 
2177                          keep the local systems in line. Fear 
2178                          of this battle station.

2180                                      TAGGE
2181                          And what of the Rebellion? If the 
2182                          Rebels have obtained a complete 
2183                          technical readout of this station, 
2184                          it is possible, however unlikely, 
2185                          that they might find a weakness and 
2186                          exploit it.

2194                          this station would be a useless 
2195                          gesture, no matter what technical 
2196                          data they've obtained. This station 
2197                          is now the ultimate power in the 
2198                          universe. I suggest we use it!

2203                          constructed. The ability to destroy 
2204                          a planet is insignificant next to 
2205                          the power of the Force.

2209                          sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your 
2210                          sad devotion to that ancient religion 
2211                          has not helped you conjure up the 
2212                          stolen data tapes, or given you 
2213                          clairvoyance enough to find the 
2214                          Rebel's hidden fort...
2215 
2216                Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's 
2217                spell.

2230                          Vader will provide us with the 
2231                          location of the Rebel fortress by 
2232                          the time this station is operational. 
2233                          We will then crush the Rebellion 
2234                          with one swift stroke.

2238                The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas 
2239                Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble 
2240                and scattered bodies.

2243                          It looks like Sandpeople did this, 
2244                          all right. Look, here are Gaffi 
2245                          sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... 
2246                          I never heard of them hitting anything 
2247                          this big before.
2248 
2249                Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

2252                          They didn't. But we are meant to 
2253                          think they did. These tracks are 
2254                          side by side. Sandpeople always ride 
2255                          single file to hide there numbers.

2258                          These are the same Jawas that sold

2263                          for Sandpeople. Only Imperial 
2264                          stormtroopers are so precise.

2267                          Why would Imperial troops want to 
2268                          slaughter Jawas?
2269 
2270                Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are 
2271                inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

2275                          may have learned who they sold them 
2276                          to. And that would lead them home!
2277 
2278                Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for 
2279                the speeder and jumps it.

2282                          Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.
2283 
2284                Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the 
2285                burning Sandcrawler.

2294                out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. 
2295                Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great 
2296                battle has taken place.

2302                Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is 
2303                stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new

2313                several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is 
2314                filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a 
2315                giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

2318                          And, now Your Highness, we will 
2319                          discuss the location of your hidden 
2320                          Rebel base.
2321 
2322                The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it 
2323                approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical 
2324                arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut 
2325                and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled 
2326                screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

2329 
2330                There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of 
2331                the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the 
2332                dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to 
2333                him.

2335                                      BEN

2338                          been killed, too, and the droids 
2339                          would be in the hands of the Empire.

2344                          want to learn the ways of the Force 
2345                          and become a Jedi like my father.

2348 
2349                The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it 
2350                zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff 
2351                overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard 
2352                array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A 
2353                harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts 
2354                his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where 
2355                Ben is standing.

2360                          and villainy. We must be cautious.
2361 
2362                Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined 
2363                smile.

2365                EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
2366 
2367                The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
2368                hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper 
2369                questions Luke.

2383                Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while 
2384                Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

2417                The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina 
2418                on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of 
2419                transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are 
2420                parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle 
2421                the speeder.

2426 
2427                As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa 
2428                away.

2458 
2459                The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow 
2460                Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy 
2461                den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic 
2462                alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At 
2463                first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
2464                furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over 
2465                drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group 
2466                of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender 
2467                stops Luke and the robots.
2468 
2469                                      BARTENDER
2470                          We don't serve their kind here!
2471 
2472                Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many 
2473                outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's 
2474                drift.

2477                          What?

2480                          Your droids. They'll have to wait 
2481                          outside. We don't want them here.
2482 
2483                Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the 
2484                Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures 
2485                along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
2486 
2487                Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
2488 
2489                                      LUKE
2490                          Listen, why don't you wait out by 
2491                          the speeder. We don't want any 
2492                          trouble.
2493 
2494                                      THREEPIO
2495                          I heartily agree with you sir.
2496 
2497                Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the 
2498                creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
2499 
2500                Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
2501                looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with 
2502                fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
2503                covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  
2504                Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, 
2505                and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a 
2506                sight to behold.
2507 
2508                Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times 
2509                during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets 
2510                out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit 
2511                disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between 
2512                Ben and the giant Wookiee.
2513 
2514                Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips 
2515                his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear 
2516                or whatever.
2517 
2518                A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.
2519 
2520                                      CREATURE

2522 
2523                The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore 
2524                the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby 
2525                Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the 
2526                belligerent monstrosity.
2527 
2528                                      HUMAN
2529                          He doesn't like you.

2536 
2537                The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some 
2538                unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young 
2539                adventurer.
2540

2543                          yourself. We're wanted men. I have 
2544                          the death sentence in twelve systems.

2551 
2552                The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
2553                moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His 
2554                three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind 
2555                Luke.
2556 
2557                                      BEN
2558                          This little one isn't worth the 
2559                          effort. Come let me buy you 
2560                          something...
2561 
2562                A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
2563                would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables 
2564                and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. 
2565                With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked 
2566                chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. 
2567                The bartender panics.
2568

2571 
2572                With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life 
2573                and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut 
2574                in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, 
2575                cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns 
2576                off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. 
2577                Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, 
2578                attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter 
2579                of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is 
2580                given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing 
2581                his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben 
2582                points the the Wookiee.

2585                          This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate 
2586                          on a ship that might suit our needs.

2590                Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on 
2591                an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
2592                droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches 
2593                two stormtroopers in the street.

2600                Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking 
2601                instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and 
2602                follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is 
2603                sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years 
2604                old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, 
2605                and cocksure.

2608                          Han Solo. I'm captain of the 
2609                          Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells 
2610                          me you're looking for passage to the 
2611                          Alderaan system.

2627                Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with 
2628                obvious misinformation.

2632                          the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. 
2633                          I'm talking about the big Corellian 
2634                          ships now. She's fast enough for 
2635                          you, old man. What's the cargo?

2651                          And it's going to cost you something

2687 
2688                Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers 
2689                looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some 
2690                questions. The bartender points to the booth.

2696                are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

2700                          really be desperate. This could really

2715                As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
2716                with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature 
2717                speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
2718 
2719                                      GREEDO

2723                          Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I 
2724                          was just going to see your boss. 
2725                          Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

2727                Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the 
2728                gun on him.
2729 
2730                                      GREEDO
2731                          It's too late. You should have paid 
2732                          him when you had the chance. Jabba's 
2733                          put a price on your head, so large 
2734                          that every bounty hunter in the galaxy 
2735                          will be looking for you. I'm lucky I 
2736                          found you first.

2743                          I found you.

2750                          time for smugglers who drop their 
2751                          shipments at the first sign of an 
2752                          Imperial cruiser.

2761                          You can tell that to Jabba. He may 
2762                          only take your ship.

2768                          That's the idea. I've been looking 
2769                          forward to killing you for a long 
2770                          time.

2774 
2775                Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of 
2776                light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as 
2777                the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up 
2778                and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some 
2779                coins as he leaves.

2822                Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a 
2823                narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking 
2824                exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and 
2825                robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and 
2826                hiding from the hot winds.

2836                          All right, check that side of the 
2837                          street. It's secure. Move on to the

2843                          I would much rather have gone with 
2844                          Master Luke than stay here with you. 
2845                          I don't know what all the trouble is 
2846                          about, but I'm sure it must be your 
2847                          fault.

2856 
2857                Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, 
2858                talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder 
2859                dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass 
2860                by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.
2861

2863                          He says it's the best he can do. 
2864                          Since the XP-38 came out, they're 
2865                          just not in demand.

2868                          It will be enough.
2869 
2870                Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty 
2871                alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like 
2872                creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his 
2873                faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature 
2874                moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as 
2875                they disappear down another alley.

2883                Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple 
2884                creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is 
2885                the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is 
2886                a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is 
2887                a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and 
2888                a huge ugly mouth.

2890                                      JABBA
2891                          Come on out, Solo!
2892 
2893                A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and 
2894                they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, 
2895                Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.
2896

2901                          I expected you would be.
2902 
2903                                      HAN
2904                          I'm not the type to run.

2907                               (fatherly-smooth)
2908                          Han, my boy, there are times when 
2909                          you disappoint me... why haven't you 
2910                          paid me? And why did you have to fry 
2911                          poor Greedo like that... after all 
2912                          we've been through together.
2913 
2914                                      HAN
2915                          You sent Greedo to blast me.
2916 
2917                                      JABBA
2918                               (mock surprise)
2919                          Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
2920                          the business. You're too valuable to 
2921                          fry. He was only relaying my concern 
2922                          at your delays. He wasn't going to 
2923                          blast you.
2924 
2925                                      HAN
2926                          I think he thought he was. Next time 
2927                          don't send one of those twerps. If 
2928                          you've got something to say to me, 
2929                          come see me yourself.
2930 
2931                                      JABBA
2932                          Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to 
2933                          dump that shipment of spice... you 
2934                          understand I just can't make an 
2935                          exception. Where would I be if every 
2936                          pilot who smuggled for me dumped 
2937                          their shipment at the first sign of 
2938                          an Imperial starship? It's not good 
2939                          business.
2940 
2941                                      HAN
2942                          You know, even I get boarded 
2943                          sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, 
2944                          but I've got a charter now and I can 
2945                          pay you back, plus a little extra. I 
2946                          just need some more time.
2947 
2948                                      JABBA
2949                               (to his men)
2950                          Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, 
2951                          I'm only doing this because you're 
2952                          the best and I need you. So, for an 
2953                          extra, say twenty percent I'll give 
2954                          you a little more time... but this 
2955                          is it. If you disappoint me again, 
2956                          I'll put a price on your head so 
2957                          large you won't be able to go near a 
2958                          civilized system for the rest of 
2959                          your short life.

2962                          Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my

2967                Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 
2968                94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.  
2969                Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. 
2970                The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder 
2971                lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small 
2972                transmitter.

2976                Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is 
2977                Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a 
2978                large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that 
2979                could only loosely be called a starship.

2982                          What a piece of junk.

2984                The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

2987                          She'll make point five beyond the 
2988                          speed of light. She may not look 
2989                          like much, but she's got it where it 
2990                          counts, kid. I've added some special 
2991                          modifications myself.
2992 
2993                Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about 
2994                all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others 
2995                to follow.

3039                Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing 
3040                into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as 
3041                he ducks into the spaceship.

3046                Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots 
3047                which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The 
3048                pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that

3101                spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the 
3102                cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

3105                          Stay sharp! There are two more coming 
3106                          in; they're going to try to cut us 
3107                          off.

3110                          Why don't you outrun them? I thought 
3111                          you said this thing was fast.
3112

3115                          going to find yourself floating home. 
3116                          We'll be safe enough once we make 
3117                          the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I 
3118                          know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 
3119                          them!

3147                          Traveling through hyperspace isn't 
3148                          like dusting crops, boy! Without 
3149                          precise calculations we could fly 
3150                          right through a star or bounce too 
3151                          close to a supernova and that'd end 
3152                          your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

3163                          make the jump to light speed.
3164 
3165                The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if 
3166                crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship 
3167                makes the jump to hyperspace.

3180                Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before 
3181                Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen 
3182                displaying a small green planet.

3191                          Governor Tarkin, I should have 
3192                          expected to find you holding Vader's 
3193                          leash. I recognized your foul stench 
3194                          when I was brought on board.

3197                          Charming to the last. You don't know 
3198                          how hard I found it signing the order 
3199                          to terminate your life!

3203                          take the responsibility yourself!
3204

3206                          Princess Leia, before your execution

3208                          ceremony that will make this battle 
3209                          station operational. No star system

3214                          Tarkin, the more star systems will 
3215                          slip through your fingers.

3219                          of this station. In a way, you have 
3220                          determined the choice of the planet 
3221                          that'll be destroyed first. Since 
3222                          you are reluctant to provide us with 
3223                          the location of the Rebel base, I 
3224                          have chosen to test this station's 
3225                          destructive power... on your home

3234                          military target? Then name the system!

3236                Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

3239                          I grow tired of asking this. So it'll 
3240                          be the last time. Where is the Rebel 
3241                          base?

3243                Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to 
3244                Alderaan.

3257                          be reasonable.

3267                          is too remote to make an effective

3280                A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A 
3281                hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  
3282                Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another 
3283                lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A 
3284                huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area 
3285                and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.

3291                robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, 
3292                seems almost faint.

3301                          were suddenly silenced. I fear 
3302                          something terrible has happened.

3304                Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then 
3305                he fixes his gaze on Luke.

3325                along a chess-type board.

3329                          about oh-two-hundred hours.
3330 
3331                Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table 
3332                covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the 
3333                table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca 
3334                seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- 
3335                covered arms over his head.

3339 
3340                Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his 
3341                stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures 
3342                to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
3343                face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. 
3344                Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and 
3345                begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

3348                          He made a fair move. Screaming about 
3349                          it won't help you.

3371                Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems 
3372                frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his 
3373                head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  
3374                Han watches with a bit of smugness.

3387                Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a 
3388                "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, 
3389                hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of 
3390                the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift 
3391                lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't 
3392                move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, 
3393                then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood 
3394                red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing

3444                missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits

3874                waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating 
3875                his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his 
3876                head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an 
3877                annoyed look.

3885                state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling 
3886                howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. 
3887                The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted

3895                          it's a wonder the whole station

3899                          Bring them on! I prefer a straight

3903                          We found the computer outlet, sir.
3904 
3905                Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of 
3906                the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it 
3907                carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  
3908                Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
3909 
3910                                      BEN

3913                          network.
3914 
3915                Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the 
3916                vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information 
3917                to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

3921                          to power the tractor beam that's 
3922                          holding the ship here. He'll try to 
3923                          make the precise location appear on 
3924                          the monitor.

3932                          will allow the ship to leave.

3963                Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps 
3964                out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey 
3965                hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head

4153                as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, 
4154                bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio 
4155                completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious 
4156                glance.
4157 
4158                Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
4159 
4160                                      LUKE
4161                          I can't see a thing in this helmet.
4162 
4163                A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away 
4164                by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and 
4165                the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.
4166 
4167                INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY
4168 
4169                Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main 
4170                passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot 
4171                similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end 
4172                of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then 
4173                disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting 
4174                that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. 
4175                No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

4178                AREA
4179 
4180                Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door 
4181                slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards 
4182                enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates 
4183                are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
4184 
4185                                      HAN
4186                          This is not going to work.

4194                INT. DETENTION AREA
4195 
4196                Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches 
4197                the trio.
4198 
4199                                      OFFICER
4200                          Where are you taking this... thing?
4201 
4202                Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut 
4203                up.
4204

4208 
4209                                      OFFICER
4210                          I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear 
4211                          it.
4212 
4213                The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
4214                the information. There are only three other troopers in the 
4215                area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the 
4216                alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of 
4217                Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
4218 
4219                Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one 
4220                of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.
4221 
4222                                      HAN
4223                          Look out! He's loose!

4228                                      HAN
4229                          Go get him!
4230 
4231                The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and 
4232                Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
4233                blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of 
4234                laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
4235                gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the 
4236                last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is 
4237                about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink 
4238                system, which is screeching questions about what is going 
4239                on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.
4240 
4241                                      HAN

4247                Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into 
4248                the buzzing comlink.

4289                Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door 
4290                away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees 
4291                the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping 
4292                and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on 
4293                her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands 
4294                staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

4427                Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and 
4428                whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink 
4429                transmitter.
4430 
4431                                      THREEPIO

4438                Someone begins banging on the door.

4446                INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR
4447 
4448                Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as 
4449                they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca 
4450                are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far 
4451                and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke 
4452                fills the narrow cell corridor.

4455                          There isn't any other way out.
4456 
4457                                      HAN
4458                          I can't hold them off forever! Now 
4459                          what?
4460 
4461                                      LEIA
4462                          This is some rescue. When you came 
4463                          in here, didn't you have a plan for 
4464                          getting out?
4465 
4466                                      HAN
4467                               (pointing to Luke)
4468                          He's the brains, sweetheart.
4469 
4470                Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
4471 
4472                                      LUKE

4474 
4475                The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in 
4476                the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
4477 
4478                                      HAN
4479                          What the hell are you doing?

4483                          the garbage chute, wise guy.
4484 
4485                She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca 
4486                look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and 
4487                says something.
4488 
4489                                      HAN
4490                          Get in there you big furry oaf! I 
4491                          don't care what you smell! Get in 
4492                          there and don't worry about it.
4493 
4494                Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the 
4495                tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their 
4496                way toward the opening.
4497 
4498                                      HAN
4499                          Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to 
4500                          kill her or I'm beginning to like

4502 
4503                Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires 
4504                off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then 
4505                slides into the chute himself and is gone.

4507                INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
4508 
4509                Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  
4510                Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He 
4511                finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't 
4512                budge.
4513 
4514                                      HAN
4515                               (sarcastically)
4516                          Oh! The garbage chute was a really 
4517                          wonderful idea. What an incredible 
4518                          smell you've discovered! Let's get 
4519                          out of here! Get away from there...

4523 
4524                Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The 
4525                laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  
4526                Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes 
4527                almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a 
4528                rather grim look on her face.

4548                A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the 
4549                murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins 
4550                to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols 
4551                drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

4578                and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around 
4579                his throat.

4598                Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the 
4599                muck by the slimy tentacle.

4605                move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  
4606                Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca 
4607                howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke 
4608                suddenly bobs to the surface.

4626                Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and 
4627                edge toward the Rebels.

4636                They place poles and long metal beams between the closing 
4637                walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
4638                trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

4651                A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for

4653                is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and 
4654                Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great 
4655                explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the 
4656                floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

4665                open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows 
4666                his bronze companion out into the office.

4684                The guard aims a blaster at them.
4685 
4686                                      THREEPIO
4687                          Oh! All this excitement has overrun 
4688                          the circuits of my counterpart here. 
4689                          If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
4690                          him down to maintenance.

4694 
4695                The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries 
4696                out the door.

4700                As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  
4701                Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his 
4702                giant paws.
4703 
4704                Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is 
4705                snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

4710                Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. 
4711                Leia begins to sink into the trash.

4730                Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall 
4731                socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from 
4732                the tiny robot.

4739                The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against 
4740                the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each 
4741                other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds 
4742                it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels 
4743                the first crushing pressure against her body.

4769                Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his 
4770                head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz 
4771                and he rips it off his belt.

4858                carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal,

4955                other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
4956                past the troopers and into the main hallway.
4957 
4958                                      SECOND TROOPER
4959                          What was that?
4960 
4961                                      FIRST TROOPER
4962                          Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
4963                          it.
4964 
4965                INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
4966 
4967                Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
4968                stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
4969                are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
4970 
4971                                      HAN
4972                               (looking at his ship)
4973                          There she is.
4974 
4975                                      LUKE
4976                          See-Threepio, do you copy?
4977 
4978                                      THREEPIO
4979                               (voice)
4980                          For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
4981                          main hangar across from the ship.
4982 
4983                                      LUKE
4984                          We're right above you. Stand by.
4985 
4986                Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
4987                the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
4988                points out the window to the ship.
4989 
4990                                      LEIA
4991                          You came in that thing? You're braver 
4992                          that I thought.
4993 
4994                                      HAN
4995                          Nice! Come on!
4996 
4997                Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
4998                hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
4999                Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
5000                taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
5001 
5002                                      FIRST TROOPER
5003                          It's them! Blast them!
5004 
5005                Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
5006                the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
5007                stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
5008                the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
5009 
5010                                      HAN
5011                               (to Luke and Leia)
5012                          Get back to the ship!
5013 
5014                                      LUKE
5015                          Where are you going? Come back!
5016 
5017                Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
5018 
5019                                      LEIA
5020                          He certainly has courage.
5021 
5022                                      LUKE
5023                          What good will it do us if he gets 
5024                          himself killed? Come on!
5025 
5026                Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
5027                muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
5028                and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.
5029 
5030                INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
5031 
5032                Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
5033                yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
5034                dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
5035                feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
5036                begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
5037                moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
5038                starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
5039                begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.
5040 
5041                INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
5042 
5043                Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
5044                to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
5045                laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
5046                extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
5047                furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
5048                the other way also.
5049 
5050                INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
5051 
5052                Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
5053                a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
5054                quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
5055                open hatchway.
5056 
5057                INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT
5058 
5059                Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
5060                that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
5061                The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
5062                and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
5063                off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
5064                his arm and pulls him back.
5065 
5066                                      LUKE
5067                               (gasping)
5068                          I think we took a wrong turn.
5069 
5070                Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
5071                reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
5072                the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
5073                that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
5074                them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
5075                Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
5076 
5077                                      LEIA
5078                          There's no lock!
5079 
5080                Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

5086                          Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
5087                          the control that extends the bridge.
5088 
5089                                      LUKE
5090                          Oh, I think I just blasted it.
5091 
5092                Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
5093                stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
5094                ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
5095 
5096                                      LEIA
5097                          They're coming through!
5098 
5099                Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
5100                laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
5101                at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
5102                the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
5103                appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
5104                and grabs at his chest.
5105 
5106                Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
5107                Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
5108                back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
5109 
5110                                      LUKE
5111                          Here, hold this.
5112 
5113                Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
5114                It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
5115                overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
5116                rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
5117                and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
5118                Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
5119                of more troops.
5120 
5121                                      LEIA
5122                          Here they come!
5123 
5124                Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
5125                he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
5126                gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
5127                tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
5128                princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
5129                quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.
5130 
5131                                      LEIA
5132                          For luck!
5133 
5134                Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
5135                to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
5136                Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
5137                stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
5138                the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
5139                the tiny subhallway.
5140 
5141                INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY
5142 
5143                Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
5144                stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
5145                to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
5146                opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
5147                the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.
5148 
5149                INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

5157                Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
5158                and right, beeping a response.

5160                INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR
5161 
5162                Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several 
5163                troopers hot on their trail.

5168                At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
5169                front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
5170                race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
5171                to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
5172                before the doors slam shut.

5179 
5180                Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
5181                where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
5182                Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
5183                ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
5184                and steps slowly forward.

5189                          is now complete.
5190 
5191                Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
5192                position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

5199                          Only a master of evil, Darth.
5200 
5201                The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
5202                moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
5203                moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
5204                as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
5205                shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.
5206 
5207                Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
5208                by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
5209                by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
5210                blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
5211                Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
5212                The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
5213                with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
5214                sound.

5222                          than you can possibly imagine.

5253                Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
5254                hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
5255                Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
5256                of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
5257                group's vantage point.

5274                Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
5275                were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
5276                Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

5286                They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
5287                charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
5288                takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
5289                his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
5290                deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.
5291 
5292                The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
5293                his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
5294                look on his face.
5295 
5296                Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
5297                cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
5298                Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
5299                empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
5300                and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
5301                and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

5308                Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
5309                their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
5310                advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

5322                Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
5323                explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
5324                forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
5325                behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
5326                docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
5327                onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
5328                as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
5329                fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

5336                troopers and races into the ship.

5828                          surely tracked us here.

5864                and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
5865                readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
5866                navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
5867                listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and

5872                          and carries a firepower greater than 
5873                          half the star fleet. It's defenses 
5874                          are designed around a direct large-
5875                          scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
5876                          should be able to penetrate the outer 
5877                          defense.

5884                          good are snub fighters going to be 
5885                          against that?
5886 
5887                                      DODONNA
5888                          Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
5889                          small one-man fighter to be any 
5890                          threat, or they'd have a tighter 
5891                          defense. An analysis of the plans 
5892                          provided by Princess Leia has 
5893                          demonstrated a weakness in the battle

5900                          The approach will not be easy. You 
5901                          are required to maneuver straight 
5902                          down this trench and skim the surface 
5903                          to this point. The target area is 
5904                          only two meters wide. It's a small 
5905                          thermal exhaust port, right below 
5906                          the main port. The shaft leads 
5907                          directly to the reactor system. A 
5908                          precise hit will start a chain 
5909                          reaction which should destroy the 
5910                          station.

5915                          Only a precise hit will set up a 
5916                          chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
5917                          shielded, so you'll have to use proton 
5918                          torpedoes.

6089                          I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll 
6090                          tell me your stories when we come

6098                          You did, all right. It's going to be 
6099                          like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
6100                          of shooting stars that'll never be

6103                Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
6104                his ship.
6105 
6106                As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
6107                spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
6108                to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
6109                back of the fighter.

6112                          This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
6113                          beat up. Do you want a new one?

6116                          Not on your life! That little droid 
6117                          and I have been through a lot 
6118                          together.
6119                               (to Artoo)
6120                          You okay, Artoo?
6121 
6122                The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
6123                the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
6124                that he is fine.
6125 
6126                Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
6127                his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
6128                hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
6129                into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
6130                beeps good-bye.

6137                          come back.

6143                          boring, would you?
6144 
6145                Artoo whistles his reply.
6146 
6147                All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
6148                The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
6149                pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
6150                hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
6151                voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
6152                are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
6153                shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
6154                holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
6155                of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

6167                eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion

7965                ship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.

8007                find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are 
8008                heading for the main reactor.

8041                flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a 
8042                supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.

8072                as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. 
8073                Princess Leia rushes toward him.

8130                Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
8131                temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
8132                are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
8133                beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
8134                march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
8135                one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
8136                Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
8137                an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
8138                whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
8139                dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
8140                dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
8141                She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
8142                winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
8143                is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
8144                troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
8145                beeps with happiness.
