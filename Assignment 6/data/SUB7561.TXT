1) I knew I had to find things to use to solve the problems
2) It was pretty easy, but at first it was confusing until you figured out where you were going
3)I used the backpack to store items I needed to fix things with
4) No, I didn't feel like I was too much in a hurry
5) I thought the program was fun.  I wish I hadn't gotten an error, so I could've finished.
6) No, I have never played games that looked like this environment.
7) I though this was experiment was really cool.
