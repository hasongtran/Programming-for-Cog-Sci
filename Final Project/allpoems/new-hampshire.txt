GOD bless New Hampshire!
from her granite peaks Once more the voice of Stark and Langdon speaks.
The long bound vassal of the exulting South For very shame her self forged chain has broken Turn the black seal of slavery from her mouth And in the clear tones of her old time spoken!
Oh all undreamed of all unhoped for changes!
The tyrants's ally proves his sternest foe To all his biddings from her mountain ranges New Hampshire thunders an indignant No!
Who is it now despairs?
Oh faint of heart Look upward to those Northern mountain cold Flouted by Freedom's victor flag unrolled And gather strength to bear a manlier part!
All is not lost.
The angel of God's blessing Encamps with Freedom on the field of fight Still to her banner day by day are pressing Unlooked for allies striking for the right!
Courage then Northern hearts!
Be firm be true What one brave State hath done can ye not also do?
