Here further up the mountain slope Than there was every any hope My father built enclosed a spring Strung chains of wall round everything Subdued the growth of earth to grass And brought our various lives to pass.
A dozen girls and boys we were.
The mountain seemed to like the stir And made of us a little while With always something in her smile.
Today she wouldn't know our name.
(No girl's of course has stayed the same.
) The mountain pushed us off her knees.
And now her lap is full of trees.
