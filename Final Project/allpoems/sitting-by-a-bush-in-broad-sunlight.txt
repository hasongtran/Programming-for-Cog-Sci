When I spread out my hand here today I catch no more than a ray To feel of between thumb and fingers No lasting effect of it lingers.
There was one time and only the one When dust really took in the sun And from that one intake of fire All creatures still warmly suspire.
And if men have watched a long time And never seen sun smitten slime Again come to life and crawl off We not be too ready to scoff.
God once declared he was true And then took the veil and withdrew And remember how final a hush Then descended of old on the bush.
God once spoke to people by name.
The sun once imparted its flame.
One impulse persists as our breath The other persists as our faith.
