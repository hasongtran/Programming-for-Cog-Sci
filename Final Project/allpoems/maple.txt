People admire the beauty of a maple when its leaves bleach from red green to yellow.
But have you ever stood under the tree where the leaves let out a soft moan when the wind gently teases it?
And the branches brace the leaves not letting go.
.
.
The sun shatters into a thousand rays between the leaves leaving a tint of lemon in patches of green.
And here i stand under the maple amazed.
