I ram a big steel door In the vastness of a mind.
Locked out for all of my natural life But I care not for what I find.
The hinges buckle as I try And try with all my might.
For I know that I will win this war This battle this eternal fight.
The door falls down as screeches scream And blast the vastness of a mind.
For as I said before I care not what I find.
