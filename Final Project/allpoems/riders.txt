Riders so proud and strong fearless never wavering.
Riders into battles long dauntless victory savoring.
Riders charging in where others fear steady always true.
Riders far and then so near flying flowing through.
Riders few that ever fall slipping silent braves.
Riders who answer the call dying no one saves.
