More than halfway up the pass Was a spring with a broken drinking glass And whether the farmer drank or not His mare was sure to observe the spot By cramping the wheel on a water bar turning her forehead with a star And straining her ribs for a monster sigh To which the farmer would make reply A sigh for every so many breath And for every so many sigh a death.
