I thought my true love slept Behind her chair I crept And pulled out a long pin The golden flood came out She shook it all about With both our faces in.
Ah!
little wren I know Your mossy small nest now A windy cold place is No eye can see my face Howe'er it watch the place Where I half drown in bliss.
When I am drowned hald dead She laughs and shakes her head Flogged by her hair waves I Withdraw my face from there But never once I swear She heard a mercy cry.
