The old orchard full of smoking air Full of sour marsh and broken boughs is there But kept no more by vanished Mulligans Or Hartigans long drowned in earth themselves Who gave this bitter fruit their care.
Here's where the cherries grew that birds forgot And apples bright as dogstars now there is not An apple or a cherry only grapes But wild ones Isabella grapes they're called Small pointed black like boughs of musket shot.
Eating their flesh half savage with black fur.
Acid and gipsy sweet I thought of her Isabella the dead girl who has lingered on Defiantly when all have gone away In an old orchard where swallows never stir.
Isabella grapes outlaws of a strange bough That in their harsh sweetness remind me somehow Of dark hair swinging and silver pins A girl half fierce half melting as these grapes Kissed here – or killed here – but who remembers now?
