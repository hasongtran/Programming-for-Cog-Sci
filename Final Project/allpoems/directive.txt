A directive has been taken To usurp all power and rule!
Secretly this has been done to us.
.
.
By one who bypasses the fools.
Dictatorship implemented Is certainly due to come.
Quietly creeps The one in this power seat.
To unravel lifestyles and the laws Of everyone.
In the days of May.
.
.
What's been said has been done!
National emergency!
Effective and declared by one!
