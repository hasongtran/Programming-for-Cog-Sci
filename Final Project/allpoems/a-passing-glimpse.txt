To Ridgely Torrence On Last Looking into His Hesperides I often see flowers from a passing car That are gone before I can tell what they are.
I want to get out of the train and go back To see what they were beside the track.
I name all the flowers I am sure they weren't Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth Not lupine living on sand and drouth.
Was something brushed across my mind That no one on earth will ever find?
Heaven gives it glimpses only to those Not in position to look too close.
